Before filing an issue, please make sure your issue is unique and hasn't been
filed already! Please leave a :+1: if you are also experiencing an issue and/or
a comment with any additional information.

For bugs, please check if the bug still persists in a fresh `develop` build!
HPCToolkit evolves quickly, it is quite possible your bug has already been fixed
in an unreleased version of HPCToolkit. Fresh unreleased builds can be obtained
via an up-to-date [Spack `develop`](https://github.com/spack/spack):
```console
$ spack install hpctoolkit@git.<commit>=develop <variants>...
```

Thank you for helping improve HPCToolkit!

  This template is for crashes of the HPCToolkit tools.

  Before you file, please make sure the title is short but specific, and
  starts with the name of the tool and the word "crash."
    Good: `hpcrun: Crash on OpenMP offloading to Intel GPU`
    Bad: `Intel OpenMP crash`

  Fill in the sections below, and remove anything that isn't relevant to your
  particular issue.

<!--
  Summarize the crash here. What did you try to do that caused the crash?
-->

### Setup
<!--
  Provide detailed instructions on how to set up the environment to reproduce
  the problem. Attach or link any source files needed to demonstrate the issue.
  If the OS or versions of any dependencies are important, list them here.

  Example:
  - Source file: [my-source.cpp](/uploads/...)
  - OS: Red Hat 8.9
  - Glibc version 2.35
  - GTPin version 3.2.1
-->

<!-- Specify the version of HPCToolkit tested in the below code block. -->
```console
$ hpcrun --version
```

### To Reproduce
<!--
  Provide detailed steps to reproduce the crash as a numbered list. List any
  commands to run in `console` code blocks. Only include command output that is
  relvant to the reproduction of the issue.

  Example:
  1. Compile and measure the test application with Intel GPU metrics enabled.
     ```console
     $ dpcpp -o my-app my-source.cpp
     $ hpcrun -e gpu=level0,inst=count ./my-app
     ```
-->

### Logs
<!--
  Provide the error message of the crash and any relevant log output in a code
  block. How frequently does this happen?
-->

<!--
  If the tool dumped core, copy the stack trace as generated by `gdb` into the
  code block below. If the tool dumped core but the stack trace cannot be
  obtained (e.g. sysadmin disabled core dumps), delete the <details></details>
  block and uncomment the line below:

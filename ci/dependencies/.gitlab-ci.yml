# NB: This is a crazy pipeline to dodge fundamental flaws in Spack:
#   - `spack ci` doesn't work on multiple environments. This means we have to
#     generate one pipeline per environment concretization.
#   - Spack has to be gently massaged / heavily tainted to cross-concretize correctly.
#     This means operations spanning multiple OSs, like concretization, need to be
#     spread out across multiple jobs and containers... and thus pipelines.
#   - Spack environments are unable to unify specs in a stable and controlled manner,
#     either all specs are concretized together (and views are possible), or
#     some to none are (and views are likely to fail). So we need multiple envionments
#     to properly express our testing dependencies.
#
# In short, if done the correct and straightforward way, we would have a combinatorial
# explosion of jobs and pipelines in this file. To avoid that, we use a "Multi-Level Pipeline" (MLP)
# approach. We let `spack ci generate` generate a boatload of pipelines, but then use an automated
# script to generate a single top-level pipeline that launches all the others. This removes most of
# the combinatorial burden, leaving us with (two) trigger jobs to launch the MLP.

# Generate a pipeline for each combination of OS and arch.

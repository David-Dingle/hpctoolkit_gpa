# If this script can't find its install directory, then set 'prefix'
# here.  This should only be necessary if you've moved both the script
# and the install directory.
#
# Set 'hash_value' to empty to disable matching the hash with the
# install directory.  Note: re-running configure creates a new hash.
# If you copy this script out of its install directory and rerun
# configure, then the hashes won't match.
